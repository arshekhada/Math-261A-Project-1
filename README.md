- **Data/** – Contains both raw (`Equity_Index_Census_Tracts.csv`) and cleaned (`Clean_Equity_Index_Census_Tracts.csv`) versions of the dataset, along with a cleaning script (`Data Cleaning.R`).

## Data

The data for this project comes from the [City of San José Open Data Portal](https://data.sanjoseca.gov/), specifically the [Equity Index Census Tracts dataset](https://data.sanjoseca.gov/dataset/equity-index-census-tracts), which was compiled using American Community Survey (ACS) 2021 5-year estimates.  

The dataset is made available under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license.  

## External Resources

The final report and code were written by Abhishek Rasikbhai Shekhada. However, the following external resources were used for preliminary research and support:

- ChatGPT used for brainstorm wording, clarify questions about R/Quarto syntax, review draft code structure and make sure the citation appears right next to the relevant statement. I made sure that all final code and text reflect my own understanding and work.
